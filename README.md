# 3D Graphics Scene Presentation

This project aims to create a photorealistic representation of 3D scenes, utilizing various graphical libraries such as OpenGL, GLFW, GLM, and others. The application enables the user to interact with and control the 3D scene through mouse and keyboard input.

## Features

- **Scene Visualization**:  
  - Users can scale, translate, rotate, and move the camera within the 3D scene using the mouse or keyboard.
  
- **Lighting**:  
  - The scene includes at least two different light sources, such as ambient, directional, or point lights, to enhance realism.
  
- **Display Modes**:  
  - The user can switch between different rendering modes: solid, wireframe, polygonal, and smooth shading.
  
- **Texturing and Materials**:  
  - The application supports texture mapping on objects with adjustable texture quality and detail levels.
  - Textures are applied to objects to enhance visual realism.
  
- **Shadow Generation**:  
  - The scene demonstrates dynamic shadow generation for added depth and realism.
  
- **Animation** 
- **Fog and fragment discarding**
